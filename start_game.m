%START_GAME is the start of the action phase of the game.
%   The passed in arrays all allow us to in find the order of people, the
%   corresponding die rolls, the space we are on, and the action at that
%   space. The setup of the program thus far ensures that it is a simple
%   task of accessing arrays in the correct order, Also, I truly dislike
%   all the commenting, as to much comment makes code look ugly and clean
%   code speaks for itself. I only say this because the loops here look
%   really large, but it is really just all comment for grading purposes.
%   Actions ar limited to one per turn. This is a personal choice to avoid
%   cascading actions as I am infering this was not the intent of the
%   project. I am assuming strange input boards where it would be one turn
%   and over.
